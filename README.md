#### I'm Abdul Fattah Ikhsan

I'm a Senior full-stack developer at [Wallex Technologies Pte Ltd](https://www.wallex.asia/). I'm also a freelance Full-Stack developer and a course instructor. I currently live in Bekasi Regency, Indonesia, which is famous for its biggest industrial estate in Southeast Asia ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cikarang)), but my house is far enough from the estate. I chose a safe and sound neighbourhood. My interests range from technology to programming, which has become my passion. In my free time, I usually read articles, news, [Talabul-ilmi Shar-i](https://youtu.be/p1ubIdnfQUM?si=gFrqBL3HBDvVBusO&t=8), listen to some podcasts, and enjoy gardening on my small-space terrace. Sometimes I travel to recharge my mood. Last but not least, if you want to get in touch, feel free to say hi through one of the social links below, I look forward to hearing from you soon.

### 17 Rules of Software Engineering

<details>
   <summary>0. Stop falling in love with your own code.</summary>
   <ul>
     <li> Why: It's easy to become attached to our creations, but code is a tool, not a pet.
     <li> Action: Be willing to refactor, rewrite, or even discard code if it's not serving its purpose.
   </ul>
</details>
<details open>
   <summary>1. You will regret complexity when on-call.</summary>
   <ul>  
     <li> Why: Complex systems are harder to understand and troubleshoot, especially when you're facing a critical issue in the middle of the night.
     <li> Action: Strive for simplicity and clarity in your designs. Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable ones.
   </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>2. Everything is a trade-off. There's no "best".</summary>
  <ul>
     <li> Why: There's always a cost to any decision, whether it's time, resources, or maintainability.
     <li> Action: Be aware of the trade-offs involved in your choices and make informed decisions.
  </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>3. Every line of code you write is a liability.</summary>
  <ul>
      <li> Why: More code means more potential bugs, more maintenance overhead, and more things to go wrong.
      <li> Action: Write only the code that's necessary, and be mindful of the impact of your changes.
  </ul>
</details>
<details>
   <summary>4. Document your decisions and designs.</summary>
   <ul>
       <li> Why: Good documentation makes it easier for others to understand your code and for you to remember your own
           design choices.
       <li> Action: Write clear and concise documentation, and keep it up-to-date.
   </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>5. Everyone hates code they didn't write.</summary>
  <ul>
     <li> Why: It's human nature to be more critical of things we didn't create.
     <li> Action: Write clean, well-structured code that's easy to understand.
  </ul>
</details>
<details>
   <summary>6. Don't use unnecessary dependencies.</summary>
   <ul>
       <li> Why: Dependencies can introduce complexity and security risks.
       <li> Action: Use dependencies only when they're truly needed, and choose them carefully.
   </ul>
</details>
<details open>
   <summary>7. Coding standards prevent arguments.</summary>
   <ul>
       <li> Why: Consistent coding standards make it easier for teams to collaborate and maintain codebases.
       <li> Action: Establish and follow coding standards within your team.
   </ul>
</details>
<details>
   <summary>8. Write meaningful commit messages.</summary>
   <ul>
       <li> Why: Good commit messages help others understand the purpose of your changes and make it easier to track
           down bugs.
       <li> Action: Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes you've made.
   </ul>
</details>
<details>
   <summary>9. Don't ever stop learning new things.</summary>
   <ul>
       <li> Why: The field of software engineering is constantly evolving, and it's important to keep up with the
           latest trends and technologies.
       <li> Action: Make time for learning new things, whether it's through books, courses, or open-source projects.
   </ul>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>10. Code reviews spread knowledge.</summary>
    <ul>
        <li> Why: Code reviews are a great way to share knowledge and learn from others.
        <li> Action: Actively participate in code reviews and be open to feedback.
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>11. Always build for maintainability.</summary>
    <ul>
        <li> Why: Maintainable code is easier to understand, modify, and debug.
        <li> Action: Write clean, well-structured code that's easy to follow. Use meaningful naming conventions and
            comments.
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>12. Ask for help when you're stuck.</summary>
    <ul>
        <li> Why: There's no shame in asking for help. Everyone gets stuck sometimes.
        <li> Action: Don't be afraid to ask your colleagues or mentors for help when you need it.
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>13. Fix root causes, not symptoms.</summary>
    <ul>
        <li> Why: Fixing the underlying problem is the only way to prevent it from happening again.
        <li> Action: Take the time to investigate the root cause of a bug or issue before implementing a fix.
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>14. Software is never completed.</summary>
    <ul>
        <li> Why: There's always room for improvement, and new features and requirements will always arise.
        <li> Action: Embrace the fact that software is an ongoing process, and be prepared to make changes as needed.
    </ul>
</details>
<details open>
    <summary>15. Estimates are not promises.</summary>
    <ul>
        <li> Why: It's difficult to predict how long a task will take, especially in software development.
        <li> Action: Be realistic about your estimates and be prepared to adjust them as needed.
    </ul>
</details>
<details open>
    <summary>16. Ship early, iterate often.</summary>
    <ul>
        <li> Why: It's better to release a product early and get feedback from users than to wait until it's "perfect."
        <li> Action: Don't be afraid to release early and often. Use feedback from users to improve your product over
            time.
    </ul>
</details>
