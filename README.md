I'm a software engineer at Wallex Technologies Pte Ltd. I'm also a freelance web developer and a course instructor. Currently, I live in Bekasi Regency, Indonesia. My interests range from technology to programming. They've become hobbies. Other hobbies are houseplants, entrepreneurship, and reading.
